I explained the project and the ROE. She said she thought there was another Sunflower project happening and was getting confused between the two. She asked if I had sent anything to Arlene in CO, she said Arlene is her niece in CO and is a trustee, and there is another trustee in WA. I let her know for the ROE, it was ok for just her to sign, but if and when we need an easement from her, all of the trustees will have to sign. I offered to correspond with the other trustees to make things easier on her as well, but she said it was not necessary at this time. She said that Dennis Zarr farms the property for her and that he had attended the first public meeting. She said she wanted to look through the documents and that she would give me a call if she had any questions.",Amy Borders

He said that regardless of the value, since it is a one-time payment and based on appraised value it isn’t worth it to the farmers that get the structures because they have to farm around them for the rest of their lives.
-	Weed management is a concern where the structures and paths are located. Bob and other neighbors are hearing from area operators that have experience with Sunflower and Coops that they aren't doing an adequate job of managing for weeds in their easement areas. He wouldn’t say who made this comment, just that it was what he is hearing in the community.

Thank you for your response. 

I have attached the handout from our public meeting last week, this contains much of the information you requested.

While there is no set deadline, we would appreciate your approval and signature as soon as possible so that our field crews can begin their work prior to winter. At this time, we are requesting permission to enter the parcels for the purpose of surveying, line alignment, staking, soil boring, conducting environmental surveys, and conducting property boundary surveys. The purpose of these activities is to gather data/information which will allow Sunflower’s design team to make informed decisions regarding the proposed transmission line alignment. 

Should 613 Agro Holdings decide not to sign the Right of Entry form and deny access to their properties, Sunflower will be unable to make informed critical decisions about the proposed transmission line route/placement.

The benefits of Sunflower’s proposed transmission line project are to grow the existing system to provide more reliable service to its cooperative members in the area, increasing the infrastructure to accommodate load growth, and reducing the number of outages by spreading the power load over additional lines.

I am happy to schedule a call and discuss the project further, my direct line is 720-360-6079. I’ll give you a call in a day to allow you time to review the attached handout.

While there is no set deadline, we would appreciate your approval and signature as soon as possible so that our field crews can begin their work prior to winter. At this time, we are requesting permission to enter the parcels for the purpose of surveying, line alignment, staking, soil boring, conducting environmental surveys, and conducting property boundary surveys. The purpose of these activities is to gather data/information which will allow Sunflower’s design team to make informed decisions regarding the proposed transmission line alignment. 

Should 613 Agro Holdings decide not to sign the Right of Entry form and deny access to their properties, Sunflower will be unable to make informed critical decisions about the proposed transmission line route/placement.

The benefits of Sunflower’s proposed transmission line project are to grow the existing system to provide more reliable service to its cooperative members in the area, increasing the infrastructure to accommodate load growth, and reducing the number of outages by spreading the power load over additional lines.

I am happy to schedule a call and discuss the project further, my direct line is 720-360-6079. I’ll give you a call in a day to allow you time to review the attached handout.

Stephen,
After considering this change, we have determined that we would not be in favor of this change as we cannot anticipate what we may want to do with this land in the future.  We would prefer to keep it as is.

Thank you.

Thank you Caverly for your response. Yes, the meeting went well; it was well attended and we gathered useful feedback from some of the landowners on the alignment.

We will keep an eye out for the ROE agreement that you are signing and sending back.

One of the design engineers approached me today and asked me to share a potential change in the alignment with you to see if it would be feasible. (Please see attached).

This change would allow for a slightly shorter line and could remove the 90 degree structure that was planned for the SW corner of your property. Please let me know if it is agreeable to the Foundation. We could also meet onsite and look at the ground together. I plan to be back in the area October 9-11th approximately.

Thank you,
Stephen

Thank you Caverly for your response. Yes, the meeting went well; it was well attended and we gathered useful feedback from some of the landowners on the alignment.

We will keep an eye out for the ROE agreement that you are signing and sending back.

One of the design engineers approached me today and asked me to share a potential change in the alignment with you to see if it would be feasible. (Please see attached).

This change would allow for a slightly shorter line and could remove the 90 degree structure that was planned for the SW corner of your property. Please let me know if it is agreeable to the Foundation. We could also meet onsite and look at the ground together. I plan to be back in the area October 9-11th approximately.

Hello Caverly and Amy,

Please find attached information related to the Sunflower Electric transmission line project. I will be your primary point of contact for the duration of this project. You likely received the Right of Entry (ROE) paperwork that was mailed to the Foundation. If you don’t have any additional questions at this time we would appreciate receiving that signed document back in the envelope that was provided. The ROE provides your permission for members of the project team to go onto your property for data collection, project design, survey, small diameter geotechnical borings, etc.

We are not certain as of yet whether there will be a need for an easement on the Foundation’s property. Further design development will help us understand that question.

As a reminder, there is a public meeting tomorrow night at the library in Cimarron from 5:30 – 8:30 PM.

Please don’t hesitate to call or email me at any time.

Thank you,
Stephen

I sent the following email to Mr. Algrim at arlynalgrim@hotmail.com to inlcude the handout from the first public meeting:
Hello Arlyn,

Thanks so much for calling me this morning. Please see the attached handout from the first public meeting. It will show you the three routes that we were initially looking at for this project. I look forward to meeting you tomorrow and talking this through with you, as I know you own and farm a lot of land out there and your opinions and concerns are valuable to us.

Have a great day!

Hello Taylor, 

Thanks for speaking with me this morning. I have attached the flyer that we handed out at the first public meeting last month, it has a lot of good information about the project. 

I also attached a map of the current proposed route for the power line. Note that this is subject to change, and also that it has not been determined which side of the road/property line the power line will go on. On this map I outlined your properties in RED, the best I could, this is in no way an accurate representation of your property lines, just a visual for you to see where your property is on the map. The Neon GREEN lines are the proposed route for the power line. After review, please let me know if you have further questions.

The right of entry form that I mailed to you is simply for us to gain access to your properties to do survey and environmental inspections, it is in no way an easement or you signing any rights away to your property. If you are comfortable signing the ROE, please do so and return it in the envelope provided. If you would like, I could come and meet with you and discuss any questions you may have, at a time convenient to you.

The public meeting is scheduled for next Tuesday the 26th at the Cimarron Public Library (120 North Main Street)– downstairs from 5:30-8:30 pm, we would love for you to join us if it is convenient for you. Please let me know if you have any further questions. Thank you!
